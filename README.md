# Ultimate Naughts and Crosses

Ultimate Naughts and Crosses is a simple augmentation of the standard version.
It is nine mini-games of naughts and crosses inside a giant game of naughts and crosses.

But what makes it so much fun is that the once simple game, 
now with a couple extra twists.
Opens up a whole new level of complexity and thought provoking fun.

The aim of the game is much the same as standard 'Naughts and Crosses'.
You must get a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line across the board with your x's (or your 0's)
The twist is ... you must play inside the mini-game that the player before you has sent you too.

i.e If I were to go first and I place my 0 in middle of the top middle mini-game, 
you would then have to play anywhere inside the middle mini-game.

Now if someone has been sent to a mini-game that has already been won, 
they would actually have been given a free pass to play wherever they please.

Your main goal is to win the greater Naughts and Crosses with a line of won (by you) mini-games.

Be smart
Be a spanner in the works
Or be coy ...
The choice is yours

Enjoy
