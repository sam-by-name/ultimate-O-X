make chosen miniGame smarter

if move could win main game mark as safe and take winning move    x
if deny would prevent victory, take it.                           x 
if move would send to a mini that would cause victory, don't!
if deny sends to the same miniGame and other win is not possible, mark as safe. x
if move would prevent victory/cause a draw, of miniGame that is crucial x half
to a 'greater board' line, take move.

if move sends them to a mini with no safe moves, send them there / aiArr[][].awesome: true!


if no smart move can be made and a good move is available, take best/ most effective move



Coding == building a ladder
Climbing higher == defying gravity
So code your way to the heavens,
Defy the unseen forces,
Only you can confine you


if move sends player to a mini where player can deny ai safely,
and better move is available, take it better move. // write function

Thoughts for my extreme ai:
Once ai knows all side effects of the immediate individual move,
it plays against itself until the end. (during its thought process)
The amount of moves it takes to end the game are counted.
If it beats itself, that move is marked as a good one.
And if it loses to itself that move is marked as a bad one.
The move that wins and takes least moves is graded higher than one with more moves.
If no wins occur, it takes the lose that takes most moves to complete. 
(in hope of human error)

different ai mindsets? defensive, aloof, aggressive ???



Redefining notSafe 

X. Sends to mini that would give player victory === UltimateBoBo
X. Sends to mini that would give player a free win === prettyBad  // player comes out better
X. Sends to mini that results in less wins (& no vic) for player than the ai === notTerrible

Sends to mini that player can freely deny === bad           // player denies not currently in safe/notSafe
Sends to mini that player can deny, but would lead ai to a safe win === soSo
Sends to mini that player can deny, but would lead ai to a free turn === decent

normalMove : Sends to mini that player wins (if !Vic), but that then sends  ai to safe win  === decent
winMove : Win sends to mini that player wins (if !Vic), but that then sends ai to safe win === prettyDecent
Sends to mini that player wins (if !Vic), but player win gives ai free turn === prettyDecent


Just because a mini can be won, doesn't make it a bad choice

expand :
If a mini that can be won by the player (and isn't a victory), would lead to 
a mini that that can be safely won by the ai ... 'tactically safe' ?? iterate 

If mini can be won by player but would lead to a 
taken mini/ai free-turn and isn't a playerVictory, mark as safe (or .. 'strategically safe')
